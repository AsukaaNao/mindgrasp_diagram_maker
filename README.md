Mindgrasp Diagram Maker

Mindgrasp Diagram Maker is an interactive diagram creation application that introduces a new way of working with visual ideas. Instead of relying solely on traditional mouse and keyboard inputs, this app leverages Computer Vision–based hand gesture recognition to control diagram interactions naturally and intuitively.

Users can create, edit, and manipulate diagrams using simple hand movements captured through a camera. Core actions such as adding nodes, deleting elements, moving the cursor, and repositioning connections can be performed seamlessly through gesture-based controls. This approach enhances creativity, accessibility, and hands-free interaction, making diagramming more engaging and efficient.

Mindgrasp is designed to explore the future of human–computer interaction by combining visual thinking tools with real-time computer vision technology.
